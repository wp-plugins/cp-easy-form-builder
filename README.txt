= Q: How can I apply CSS styles to the form fields? =

A: Into the form editor, click a field to edit its details, there is a setting there named "Add CSS Layout Keywords". You can add the class name into that field, so the style specified into the CSS class will be applied to that field.

Note: Don't add style rules directly there but the the name of a CSS class.

You can place the CSS class either into the CSS file of your template or into the file "cp-easy-form-builder\css\stylepublic.css" located into the plugin's folder.
